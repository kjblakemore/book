# Method

The main question is too general and too vague. As a class, we brainstormed and came up with a list of specific questions that are easier to tackle while useful for making the decision.

From the class discussion, we wrote down five specific questions that are particularly interesting.

1. Which web frameworks are forked the most?
2. Which web frameworks are starred the most?
3. Which web frameworks are referenced the most in github.
4. What constitutes a web framework?
5. Is the company interested in front-end frameworks, server side, or both?

From the above list, my team chose a question, worked on it, and created a report on the next page.

We decided to answer question 2 for server-side frameworks, using the star count from  [Web Application Frameworks](https://github.com/showcases/web-application-frameworks?s=starskar).  We felt this was a better indication of popularity than forking, since the latter indicates how often the repository was copied for development purposes, rather than usage in an application.
